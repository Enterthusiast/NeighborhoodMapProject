Getting started
===============

Launch the app

- Or open the following URL: https://enterthusiast.github.io/NeighborhoodMapProject/

IMPORTANT: You need an internet connection for this application to work.

You will not be able to pursue further.

Using it
- Once the map and markers are visible you can:
	- Drag the map to move around.
	- Click on the marker for more information on each places. Note that before the markers list is loaded some information might be unavailable.

- Once the markers list on the left panel is populated you can:
	- Click on a place to highlight the marker and open the infowindow offering more details; like an image, the name of the place, the adress, the phone number, the ratings (Google & Yelp), the place website (Official & Yelp)
	- Type in the text field to filter the markers list
	- Check a marker checkbox to prevent the marker from being filtered, so it can stick on the map. It's a very effective way to keep track of the places you really want to visit.

- When interacting with an infowindow you can:
	- Click on the phone number (if any) to directly call the place if you are on mobile. On a computer you can choose a compatible application to place the call.
	- Click on the webite (if any) to get to the place official website.
	- Click on the Yelp logo (if any) to access the yelp page, where you will get access to comments on the place and more.

TODO
====

- Grunt minify
